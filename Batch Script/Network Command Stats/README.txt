Wanted to get a little bit more familiar with what Batch Script even is (which to my understanding is just a windows executable text file that can work with command line commands).

This .bat file contains some documentation that aided me in understanding the syntax of batch script. I discovered that adding comments on your code in batch script can get pretty annoying very quickly
because you either need to start an entirely new line using '::' / 'REM' or you have to do '& ::' on each line of code after you actually write the important commands.
